OuterBuddy is a cross-country marketplace platform designed to help users purchase items from overseas at fair prices, bypassing the exorbitant costs typically associated with importing or using platforms like Amazon.

## What Problem Does OuterBuddy Solve?

Often, people want to buy products that are not available in their own country. Importing these items or buying from global e-commerce giants can be prohibitively expensive due to import duties, shipping fees, and platform markups.

OuterBuddy offers a unique solution:
- **Users can post requests** for items they wish to buy from other countries, specifying the desired product and their location.
- **Travelers can browse these requests**: If someone is traveling from the requested item's country to the buyer's country, they can purchase the product, bring it along on their journey, and sell it directly to the requester.
- **Both parties benefit**: The buyer gets the item at a fair price, while the traveler earns a profit for their help.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Requesting an Item**
   - Users submit requests for items they wish to purchase from abroad.
   - Each request includes product details, desired price, and location.

2. **Matching Travelers**
   - Travelers who are planning trips between relevant countries can view open requests.
   - If they're able to fulfill a request, they can purchase the item and deliver it once they arrive.

3. **Transaction**
   - Upon meeting, the traveler sells the item at an agreed-upon fair price.
   - Transactions are conducted in person, avoiding import fees and extra charges.

## Features

- **Marketplace for Overseas Requests**: Post, browse, and manage requests for international items.
- **Traveler Matching**: Connects buyers with travelers who can fulfill their requests.
- **Fair Pricing**: Avoids inflated costs from import duties and shipping.
- **Community Driven**: Empowers individuals to help each other access global products.
